The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept that defines how browsers calculate the size, spacing, and positioning of elements on a webpage. Every HTML element is represented as a rectangular box composed of several layers: **content**, **padding**, **border**, and **margin**.

Each layer affects how much space the element occupies and how it interacts with surrounding elements.
