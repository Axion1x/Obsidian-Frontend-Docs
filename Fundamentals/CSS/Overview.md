**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a webpage written in HTML.  
It defines how elements should be displayed — including layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and animations.

CSS separates content from design, allowing developers to keep their HTML clean and focus on structure, while styles are managed independently.  
This separation makes it easier to maintain, update, and reuse code across different pages or projects.

Modern CSS also supports **responsive design**, meaning a website can automatically adjust its layout and appearance based on the device or screen size.

In practice, CSS works together with HTML and JavaScript to create the visual and interactive parts of a website.  
While HTML builds the structure and JavaScript adds behavior, CSS controls the overall look and feel.
